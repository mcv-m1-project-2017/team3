**Week 1:**

    Fill the 'test_2017' and 'train_2017' folders with the test and train splits. 
    Go to the 'week1' folder and execute the 'main.m' script with Matlab. 
    The 'main.m' script contains the code for tasks 1, 2, 3 and 4.
    The different strategies that we used to solve each tasks are commented in detail in the scripts. 
    In order to generate the masks for the test split, execute the 'test.m' script with Matlab. 
    The output binary masks will be stored as png files in the following directory: test_2017/test/mask.
